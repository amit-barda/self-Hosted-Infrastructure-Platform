## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure Process

We follow responsible disclosure practices to ensure security vulnerabilities are addressed promptly while minimizing exposure to potential attackers.

### 1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues
Security vulnerabilities must be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Security Contact
Send detailed reports to: [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com)

**Required Information:**
- CVE identifier (if applicable)
- Vulnerability description and classification
- Proof of concept or reproduction steps
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if available)
- Affected components and versions

### 3. Response SLA
- **Initial Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Preliminary Assessment**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Timeline**: 30 days for critical, 90 days for others
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated after patch availability

## Security Best Practices

### For System Administrators
1. **Regular Updates**: Implement automated security updates for all components
2. **Access Control**: Use strong authentication and implement role-based access control
3. **Network Segmentation**: Implement proper firewall rules and network isolation
4. **Encryption**: Ensure all data in transit and at rest is encrypted
5. **Monitoring**: Deploy comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions
6. **Backup Security**: Implement encrypted backups with off-site storage
7. **Incident Response**: Establish incident response procedures and team

### For Developers
1. **Secure Development**: Follow OWASP guidelines and secure coding practices
2. **Dependency Management**: Regularly audit and update dependencies
3. **Input Validation**: Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization
4. **Authentication**: Use secure authentication mechanisms and session management
5. **Error Handling**: Implement secure error handling without information disclosure

## Security Architecture

### Network Security
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: End-to-end encryption with automatic certificate management
- **Container Isolation**: Network segmentation with dedicated Docker networks
- **Port Management**: Minimal exposed ports with proper firewall configuration
- **DDoS Protection**: Rate limiting and traffic filtering capabilities

### Application Security
- **OWASP Compliance**: Comprehensive security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication support and session management
- **Input Validation**: Service-level input sanitization and validation
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information disclosure

### Infrastructure Security
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions for all services
- **Secret Management**: Environment-based configuration with no hardcoded secrets
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security monitoring and compliance
- **Resource Controls**: CPU and memory limits to prevent resource exhaustion attacks

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted using industry-standard algorithms
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access control for all services
- **Backup Encryption**: Automated encrypted backups with integrity verification

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Change default passwords
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Enable automatic backups
- [ ] Review and customize security headers
- [ ] Test SSL certificate generation
- [ ] Verify service isolation
- [ ] Document access procedures

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2). Critical security fixes may be released as hotfixes.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
1. Report vulnerabilities privately
2. Allow time for fixes to be developed
3. Coordinate public disclosure
4. Credit security researchers appropriately
